    <!-- About Me 內容 -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       I am a student studying FinTech, and I have a strong interest in hedge funds. Even though my school courses don’t match the real world and I had little support, I chose to push myself. I taught myself and finished many projects on finance and blockchain, such as portfolio management, building trading models, creating DAOs and cryptocurrencies. I did everything by myself and shared my work on GitHub and my personal website. I once managed HKD 320,000 on my own, investing in both the US and China markets with full risk control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe hedge funds need people who take action, solve problems, and keep improving — even when working alone. I want to grow through real experience and turn my skills into something useful for a team.

      <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
      <p>
      In my first year, I was afraid of coding and math, so my GPA was only 2.5. Later, I worked hard and raised it to over 3.7+, getting A grades in all core tech subjects. But more important than grades, I think my real growth is shown by managing HKD 320,000 in assets and completing several finance and blockchain projects. This shows my strong determination.
