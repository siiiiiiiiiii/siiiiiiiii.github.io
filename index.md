    <!-- About Me -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a student studying FinTech, and I have a strong interest in hedge funds. Even though my school courses don’t match the real world and I had little support, I chose to push myself. I taught myself and finished many projects on finance and blockchain, such as portfolio management, building trading models, creating DAOs and cryptocurrencies. I did everything by myself and shared my work on GitHub and my personal website. I once managed HKD 320,000 on my own, investing in both the US and China markets with full risk control.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe hedge funds need people who take action, solve problems, and keep improving — even when working alone. I want to grow through real experience and turn my skills into something useful for a team.

      <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
      <p>
        In my first year, I was afraid of coding and math, so my GPA was only 2.5. Later, I worked hard and raised it to over 3.7+, getting A grades in all core tech subjects. But more important than grades, I think my real growth is shown by managing HKD 320,000 in assets and completing several finance and blockchain projects. This shows my strong determination.

      <p>
        I began investing in my first year of university, using the money-weighted return as a performance metric. In the first year, I achieved a 9% return, which increased to 20% in the second year. In the third year, I expanded into both the U.S. and Chinese markets, allocating to recession-resilient assets. I ensured each stock accounted for only 1–5% of the portfolio to withstand macroeconomic volatility. As of April 15, I successfully limited this year's drawdown to -3.99% (compared to the S&P 500’s -8.25%, NASDAQ’s -12.88%, and Nikkei’s -14.1%). My portfolio reached a peak value of HKD 320,000, including a six-figure amount entrusted entirely to me by my father, demonstrating my asset management ability, risk control awareness, and fiduciary responsibility beyond the level of my peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that great long-term investors don't rely on predicting the market, but on asset allocation to weather any storm!
