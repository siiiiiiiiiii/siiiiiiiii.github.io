## About Me

I am a Financial Technology student with a long-standing passion for hedge funds.  
Confronted with a disconnect between coursework and real-world practice, and a lack of resources and support, I chose to push beyond these limitations through self-learning.

I independently completed multiple finance and blockchain projects—from portfolio management and quantitative model development to DAO and cryptocurrency design—all fully implemented by myself and open-sourced on GitHub and my personal website.

At one point, I managed assets totaling HKD 320,000 across both U.S. and Chinese markets with full responsibility for risk control and strategy.

I firmly believe hedge funds need not passive learners, but proactive problem-solvers—people who can keep progressing and forge their own path, even alone.  
I am eager to grow through real-world experience and turn my skills into tangible value for a team.
