    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a Financial Technology student with a long-standing passion for hedge funds. 
      Confronted with a disconnect between coursework and real-world practice, and a lack of 
      resources and support, I chose to push beyond these limitations through self-learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I independently completed multiple finance and blockchain projects—from portfolio management 
      and quantitative model development to DAO and cryptocurrency design—all fully implemented by 
      myself and open-sourced on GitHub and my personal website.
    </p>

    <p>
      At one point, I managed assets totaling HKD 320,000 across both U.S. and Chinese markets with 
      full responsibility for risk control and strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I firmly believe hedge funds need not passive learners, but proactive problem-solvers—
      people who can keep progressing and forge their own path, even alone. I am eager to grow 
      through real-world experience and turn my skills into tangible value for a team.
