    <!-- About Me -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a FinTech student with a passion for hedge funds. Faced with the disconnect between coursework 
        and realâ€‘world application, as well as a lack of resources and support, I chose to push beyond 
        limitations through selfâ€‘learning. I independently completed multiple projects in finance and blockchain 
        â€” from portfolio management to quantitative model development, and even DAO and cryptocurrency design â€” 
        all of which I personally built and openâ€‘sourced on GitHub and my personal website. At one point, I 
        managed assets totaling HKDÂ 320,000, spanning both U.S. and Chinese markets with full responsibility 
        for risk control and execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that hedge funds donâ€™t need passive learners â€” they need individuals who can solve 
        problems independently, keep improving, and forge a path even when working alone. I am eager to grow 
        through handsâ€‘on experience and turn my abilities into tangible value for a team.

      <p>
        In my first year, I struggled with programming and mathematics, resulting in a GPA of onlyÂ 2.5. Since then, 
        I have raised it to aboveÂ 3.7+, achieving A grades in all core technology courses. More than grades, it is 
        my continuous selfâ€‘improvement and realâ€‘world accomplishments â€” including managing a HKDÂ 320,000 portfolio 
        and completing multiple finance and blockchain projects â€” that truly reflect my determination.

      <h2>Technical & Investment Projects</h2>
      <p class="project-title">1: Selfâ€‘Initiated Investment & Portfolio Management</p>
      <p>
        I began investing in my first year, using moneyâ€‘weighted return (MWR) as my performance metric. 
        I achieved a 9% return in the first year and improved to 20% in the second. In the third year, 
        I expanded into both U.S. and Chinese markets, allocating capital to recessionâ€‘resistant assets, 
        limiting each stock to 1â€“5% of total portfolio value to mitigate macroeconomic volatility. 
        As of AprilÂ 15, I successfully limited this yearâ€™s drawdown to â€“3.99%, compared to S&PÂ 500 (â€“8.25%), 
        NASDAQ (â€“12.88%), and Nikkei (â€“14.1%). My portfolio peaked at HKDÂ 320,000, including a sixâ€‘figure sum 
        entrusted solely to me by my father â€” a strong vote of confidence in my assetâ€‘management skills, 
        riskâ€‘control awareness, and sense of fiduciary responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that great longâ€‘term investors donâ€™t rely on market predictions â€” they rely on 
        asset allocation to weather the storm.

      <h2>2. Quantitative Trading & Dataâ€‘Driven Models</h2>

      <!-- 2.1 Pairs Trading -->
      <p class="project-title">2.1: Cointegrationâ€‘Based Pairs Trading Model</p>
      <p>
        Built a Cointegration Pairs Trading Model, incorporating Johansen cointegration test, OLS hedge ratio, 
        ATR-based stop loss, target volatility leverage adjustment, and multi-stage parameter optimization. 
        In a 6â€‘year backtest, the model achieved an annualized return of 6.27%, annualized volatility of 9.21%, 
        a Sharpe Ratio of 0.68, a Sortino Ratio of 0.78, and a maximum drawdown of -8.67%, demonstrating risk control.
      </p>
      <p>
        During out-of-sample testing, the model performed better than during training. It delivered an annualized 
        return of 8.64%, a Sharpe Ratio of 0.80, while maintaining a stable maximum drawdown. This suggests the 
        model was not overfitted and performed better on unseen data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the annualized return of 6.27% was lower than the Buyâ€‘andâ€‘Hold strategy (24.32%), the strategyâ€™s 
        annualized volatility was only 9.21% (vs 28.74%), and maximum drawdown was -8.67% (vs -40.54%), and full 
        market neutrality. This implies that the strategy can generate alpha regardless of market direction, offering 
        stable longâ€‘term gains.

      <p class="project-title">2.2: LSTM with Attention for Logâ€‘Return Prediction</p>
      <p>
        A financial timeâ€‘series forecasting model was built using LSTM with an Attention mechanism. It converged 
        stably within 100 training epochs with no obvious signs of overfitting, as training and validation losses 
        closely overlapped throughout. On the test set, it achieved MAEÂ =Â 0.0127 and RMSEÂ =Â 0.0176, significantly 
        outperforming the Naive Baseline (RMSEÂ =Â 0.0248), demonstrating high accuracy.
