    <!-- About Me -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a FinTech student with a passion for hedge funds. Faced with the disconnect between coursework 
        and real-world application, as well as a lack of resources and support, I chose to push beyond 
        limitations through self-learning. I independently completed multiple projects in finance and blockchain 
        â€” from portfolio management to quantitative model development, and even DAO and cryptocurrency design â€” 
        all of which I personally built and open-sourced on GitHub and my personal website. At one point, I 
        managed assets totaling HKD 320,000, spanning both U.S. and Chinese markets with full responsibility 
        for risk control and execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that hedge funds donâ€™t need passive learners â€” they need individuals who can solve 
        problems independently, keep improving, and forge a path even when working alone. I am eager to grow 
        through hands-on experience and turn my abilities into tangible value for a team.

      <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
      <p>
        In my first year, I struggled with programming and mathematics, resulting in a GPA of only 2.5. Since then, 
        I have raised it to above 3.7+, achieving A grades in all core technology courses. More than grades, it is 
        my continuous self-improvement and real-world accomplishments â€” including managing a HKD 320,000 portfolio 
        and completing multiple finance and blockchain projects â€” that truly reflect my determination.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Certificates -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Certifications</h2>
      <p>
        IELTS Overall Band: 6.5 (Listening 7, Reading 7, Writing 6.5, Speaking 6); currently focusing on 
        improving speaking; Passed HKSI Paper 1
      </p>

      <h2>Technical & Investment Projects</h2>
      <p class="project-title">1: Self-Initiated Investment & Portfolio Management</p>
      <p>
        I began investing in my first year, using money-weighted return (MWR) as my performance metric. 
        I achieved a 9% return in the first year and improved to 20% in the second. In the third year, 
        I expanded into both U.S. and Chinese markets, allocating capital to recession-resistant assets, 
        limiting each stock to 1â€“5% of total portfolio value to mitigate macroeconomic volatility. 
        As of April 15, I successfully limited this yearâ€™s drawdown to -3.99%, compared to S&P 500 (-8.25%), 
        NASDAQ (-12.88%), and Nikkei (-14.1%). My portfolio peaked at HKD 320,000, including a six-figure sum 
        entrusted solely to me by my father â€” a strong vote of confidence in my asset management skills, 
        risk control awareness, and sense of fiduciary responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that great long-term investors donâ€™t rely on market predictions â€” they rely on 
        asset allocation to weather the storm.
      </p>
