Iâ€™m a passionate Financial Technology student with a strong interest in hedge funds, quantitative trading, and blockchain innovation.

Facing the limitations of outdated university curricula and a lack of institutional support, I chose to go beyond the classroom and build my own path through self-learning. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve independently developed multiple projectsâ€”from portfolio management and statistical arbitrage models to DAO-based governance tokens and fully deployed smart contracts.

All of my work is self-built, fully documented, and open-sourced on GitHub and my personal website.

My personal investment portfolio once reached over HKD 320,000, with diversified allocations across both U.S. and Chinese markets, managed entirely by myself with strict risk control.

I believe hedge funds are not looking for passive learners, but for individuals who actively solve problems, grow consistently, and push boundariesâ€”even when working alone. I am eager to contribute meaningfully in real-world financial environments and turn my passion into tangible value.
